    <h1>On `ug`</h1>
    <p>
            But who watches the Watchmen? `ug` is an attempt to wrangle software distributed in the form of <code>curl | sh</code> one-liners. 
        What is to follow details the process I undertook while writing it. To say I wrote it alone would be disingenuous, as I had 
        assistance from GPT-4. I began by implementing primitive versions on my own in various programming languages, but settled on POSIX sh because 
        of the brevity of the collective code, as the final product comes out to 69 lines, including the newline at the end of the file. My first 
        attempt at computer-assisted programming was unstructured and naive, thus not very fruitful. I then read about gwern's 
        <a href="https://gwern.net/tla#inner-monologue">methodology</a>, and immediately began to see better results when I applied it to my work. 
        The cadence was slow, but I found that the prompt-implement-test loop was a good model for both myself, so I didn't get lost, and for GPT, 
        so it could build a context. I worked my way one-by-one through GPT's suggestions, ensuring that it produced code that passed existing test cases 
        and new ones specific to that feature, and if not, we dove into whatever the offending issue was. It helped that I had the desired commands 
        specified prior to beginning, as I found from other projects that changing problem requirements mid-way through led to a bit of a mess, 
        for that project I've scrapped everything and restarted alone. My overall verdict on GPT-4 is that it was incredibly useful for something 
        this small, and it saved me a lot of time and cognitive energy. I'm happy about how `ug` came out, and I hope you find it useful 
        (if you dare to use it at all).
