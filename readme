ug - an ad-hoc `curl | sh` install script manager

if you choose to use this, do so at your own risks
links may change
i make no guarantees

so, this is all you need to do:

create a text file at `~/.local/share` called `l_l`
format the given install script as follows:

<label>:<script>

this must be on one line only

ug accepts one argument with two possibilities:

all - execute all install scripts
<label> - execute the install script for the specified label
